Entry for best use of WhenHub API

The app can be downloaded from http://outoftheboatinc.com/whenhubBE/getapp.php.  If you have issues downloading the app, email me and I will upload a copy to the Google Play Store for you.

This app uses the WhenHub APIs to manage my daughter's travel softball schedule.  This is the coaches version of the app.  A coach can create schedules (seasons) and add events (tournaments) to the season.  The coach can also edit events.
